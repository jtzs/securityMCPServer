# Model Context Protocol Server

A server designed to facilitate **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** integration for various **security tools**. Built with simplicity in mind, this project aims to help security professionals experiment with context-driven model interactions in a structured and auditable way.

## 🔍 Overview

This project acts as a middleware layer between AI models and security tooling, providing:
- A protocol server to exchange contextual model inputs/outputs
- Extensible architecture for integrating with other tools (e.g., vulnerability scanners, logging systems, SOC platforms)

> ⚠️ This is a **work-in-progress** project by an amateur developer with a professional background in cybersecurity. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Language: `Typescript`
- MCP Framework: [modelcontextprotocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
- Validator: `ZOD`
- Security tools (Installer not included): [nmap](https://nmap.org)

## Future improvements

- Secret Vault: `HashiCorp Vault`
- Security Tools: [amass](https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass)

## 🔧 Usage
